### Revenue Analysis:

In the fourth quarter, revenue increased 14.3%
sequentially, supported by strong demand for our
industry-leading 3nm and 5nm technologies.

By technology, 3nm process technology contributed
26% of total wafer revenue in 4Q24, while 5nm and 7nm
accounted for 34% and 14% respectively. Advanced
technologies (7nm and below) accounted for 74% of
total wafer revenue.

By platform, HPC and Smartphone represented 53%
and 35% of net revenue respectively, while IoT,
Automotive, DCE, and Others each represented 5%,
4%, 1%, and 2%.

Sequentially, revenue from HPC, Smartphone,
Automotive, and others increased 19%, 17%, 6%, and
2% respectively from 3Q24, while IoT and DCE
decreased 15%, and 6% respectively.

From a geographic perspective, revenue from
customers based in North America accounted for 75%
of total net revenue in 4Q24, while revenue from China,
Asia Pacific, Japan, and EMEA (Europe, Middle East,
and Africa) accounted for 9%, 9%, 4%, and 3% of total
net revenue respectively.

On a full year basis, 3nm contribution reached 18% of
total wafer revenue in 2024 while 5nm and 7nm process
technology contributed 34% and 17% respectively.

### Gross Profit Analysis:

Gross margin was 59.0% in 4Q24, 1.2 percentage
points higher than 3Q24, primarily due to a higher
capacity utilization rate and productivity gains, partially
offset by dilution from the continued ramp-up of our 3-
nanometer technology.

On a full year basis, gross margin was 56.1% in 2024,
up 1.7 percentage points from 2023, mainly reflecting a
higher capacity utilization rate, partially offset by N3
dilution and higher electricity costs.


### Operating Income Analysis:

Total operating expenses increased NT$7.26 billion to
NT$86.34 billion in 4Q24. Given a higher gross margin,
operating margin improved 1.5 percentage points
sequentially to 49.0% in 4Q24.

For full year 2024, total operating expenses
represented 10.4% of net revenue as compared to
11.8% in 2023, mainly due to operating leverage.


### Non-Operating Items:

Total non-operating items were a gain of NT$23.09
billion in 4Q24, compared to a gain of NT$23.42 billion
in 3Q24.

On a full year basis, total non-operating items increased
by NT$26.09 billion to a gain of NT$83.79 billion in
2024, mainly reflecting a higher interest income.


### Net Profit and EPS:

Net income attributable to shareholders of the parent
company was NT$374.68 billion in 4Q24, up 15.2%
from 3Q24 and up 57.0% from 4Q23.

On a full year basis, both net income and EPS
increased by 39.9% from 2023.

### Liquidity Analysis:

On a sequential basis, total current assets increased by
NT$314.44 billion, mainly due to the increase of
NT$254.42 billion in cash and marketable securities and
NT$22.12 billion in accounts receivable.

Total current liabilities increased by NT$184.13 billion,
mainly due to the increase of NT$70.91 billion in
accounts payable and NT$99.20 billion in accrued
liabilities and others.

Net working capital was NT$1,823.82 billion and current
ratio was 2.4x in 4Q24.

Days of receivable decreased 1 day to 27 days in
4Q24.

Days of inventory decreased 7 days to 80 days in
4Q24, primarily due to higher N3 and N5 wafer
shipments.


### Debt Service:

Net cash reserves increased NT$231.10 billion to
NT$1,403.73 billion in 4Q24, mainly due to the
increase of NT$254.42 billion in cash and marketable
securities.
